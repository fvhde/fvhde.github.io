<p>Feel like you’re losing the battle with your own systems? Worried that you’ve built up a tangled web of legacy business rules and feeling like you need to start afresh?</p>
<p>Want to implement something new but don't know where to begin?</p>

<p>We can help you. Here’s how we operate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete export of all Zendesk objects: views, macros, triggers, automations, roles, groups, and so on.</li>
  <li>Version control: track all changes and develop a release schedule.</li>
  <li>Process mapping: find how everything within your Zendesk interacts. Be sure where each ticket goes.</li>
  <li>Cleanup: orphaned objects are carefully removed, broken references are resolved, non-functional items are disabled.</li>
  <li>Testing and deployment process: be sure your changes are effective.</li>
  <li>Dedicated support from a human</li>

<p>Sounds good? Get in touch.</p>
