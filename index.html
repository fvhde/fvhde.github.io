<h1>Deltastring — DevOps your Zendesk</h1>

<p>Feel like you’re losing the battle with your own systems? Worried that you’ve built up a tangled web of legacy business rules and feeling like you need to start afresh? Want to implement something new and exciting but don't know where to begin?</p>

<p>We can help you.</p>

<p>We are a boutique Zendesk implementation agency, with a team assembled from experienced specialists, based in the South of England. Here is how we operate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete export of all Zendesk objects: views, macros, triggers, automations, roles, groups, and so on.</li>
  <li>Version control: track all changes and develop a release schedule.</li>
  <li>Process mapping: find how everything within your Zendesk interacts. Be sure where each ticket goes.</li>
  <li>Cleanup: orphaned objects are carefully removed, broken references are resolved, non-functional items are disabled.</li>
  <li>Testing and deployment process: be sure your changes are effective.</li>
  <li>All the while enjoy enhanced support from friendly humans.</li>
</ul>

<p>Deltastring Ltd is led by Nico Boyce, whose CV includes exciting startups and established tech giants, each of whom had their own distinct set of Zendesk challenges. He's assisted by a superhero squad of CX and Ops pros on a freelance basis, with experience from a selection of sectors.</p>
