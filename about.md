title: About Me
---

After years of experience as a Test Lead working on test strategy, planning, test management etc. I started working in cloud first, CI/CD projects and really enjoyed the more technical aspect to these projects.

To further my knowledge and skills I joined a tech consultancy to gain hands on experience of test engineering, including automation, test tools, CI/CD, Non Functional testing and more.

Working in successful, productive agile teams in CI/CD projects has given me a great insight into how automated testing fits into an effective project delivery, the role quality and testing plays in this and a technical understanding of the tools and technology involved.

## About the Testio Tech blog

One of the interesting challenges of working in software testing is keeping up to date with the pace of change in our industry- for example in terms of disruption from AI, evolving or emerging test tools, certifications and so on. Having shared my approach to using AI, practical exprieence of test tools with test groups such as Test Talks and my colleages, it struck me that I should also post this on a blog.

Finally, as I'm based in Wales the word 'Testio' is a slang/informal word for testing in Welsh (emphasis on informal!) so its a bi-lingual blog title!
