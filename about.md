# Deltastring build Zendesk solutions.

It's as simple as that. You bring the Zendesk, we'll bring the solutions.

### It's not that simple though, is it?

Well no, at least not for us. We have a [methodology](https://deltastring.com/2024/05/22/unlock-zendesk-with-deltastring/) you can read about. We also have a manifesto in development. Beyond that, we have a stack of laptops and a big ol' archive of scripts and processes and hopes and dreams.

### So who are you?

I am Nico Boyce. You can read more about me on [this page](https://deltastring.com/nico/) or even more on my personal website [nicoboyce.com](https://nicoboyce.com). I'm the leader of Deltastring, primarily focused on the technical and engineering side of things. We have some top freelancers in the Deltastring family with expertise across operations and CX functions.
