title: About Me
---

After years of experience as a Test Lead working on test strategy, planning, test management etc. I started working in cloud first, CI/CD projects and really enjoyed the more technical aspect to these projects.

To further my knowledge and skills I joined a tech consultancy to gain hands on experience of test engineering, including automation, test tools, CI/CD, Non Functional testing and more.

Working in successful, productive agile teams in CI/CD projects has given me a great insight into how automated testing fits into an effective project delivery, the role quality and testing plays in this and a technical understanding of the tools and technology involved.

## About the Testio Test blog

One of the rewarding aspects of a career in software testing is the wealth of collaboration and innovation in the testing community, including many great blogs/websites (too many to mention here) and brilliant groups such as Ministry of Testing Meetups and Test Talks. I've benefited a great deal from the community and I'd like to use this blog to make my own small contribution, so I hope you find it useful and of some interest.

Finally, as I'm based in Wales the word 'Testio' is a slang/informal word for testing in Welsh (emphasis on informal!) so its a bi-lingual blog title!
