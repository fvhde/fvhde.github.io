title: About Deltastring
---

We are a boutique Zendesk implementation agency, with a team assembled from experienced specialists.

We specialise in bringing DevOps processes to govern your Zendesk and associated tooling.

## What can Deltastring do for you?

Feel like you're losing the battle with your own systems? Worried that you've built up a tangled web of legacy business rules and feeling like you need to start afresh?

We can help you. Here's how we operate:

* Complete export of all Zendesk objects: views, macros, triggers, automations, roles, groups, and so on.
* Version control: track all changes and develop a release schedule.
* Process mapping: find how everything within your Zendesk interacts. Be sure where each ticket goes.
* Cleanup: orphaned objects are carefully removed, broken references are resolved, non-functional items are disabled.
* Testing and deployment process: be sure your changes are effective.
