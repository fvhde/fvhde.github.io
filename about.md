My name is **Alessandro Grisa**, alias **0-Phat**. 
As my blog description says, I'm a Infosec enthusiast, who's working as Red Teamer for two years.
This blog has been created to share my, hopefully interesting, posts and research.

I will upload any code or project that I will share on my Github, in order to be available to anyone.

Feel free to contact me using one of the following vectors:

Enjoy the reading and Hack the Planet!
