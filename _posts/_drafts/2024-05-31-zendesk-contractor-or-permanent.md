I'm no salesperson, but the nature of starting an agency is such that I frequently find myself having to do things I am not built for. One of my favourites is having to justify the entire concept of contracting. Why hire contractors at all? Well here's my view.





The trick is to reposition yourself on the balance sheet. These companies, the top people look at everything as entries on the balance sheet and they don’t look beyond. If you hire someone to do a job on an ongoing basis, that adds a lot in liabilities. You need to spend so much money to employ someone it’s insane. Not just their pay and tax, but also they need a pension, training, uniform maybe, a chair and a laptop, you need to put them through loads of courses for compliance and insurance, you need to insure them from you, you from them, etc


then there’s ongoing costs like office space (light, head, internet, water, etc)

A £50k salary hire realistically costs £90k over the year, especially with the cost of recruiting them, holiday, sick leave, a million other things


to a manager, I sound expensive because I charge a lot of money for what I do, but to a director or a COO or CEO then they see that I go elsewhere on the balance sheet, I come out of different budgets, I reduce tax for them, I don’t need any of those other things, also they pay me once, I do the job, they don’t have to make me redundant


Yes to an extent. But besides bringing my own laptop, I can also do a lot of things permanent employees can’t. If they are needing a specific tool built, I can just hire someone else to do it and send them instead. To a manager, it sounds like a negative that I can just subcontract and send someone else to do the job. But to a director or above, they know that this in the real world means that they get specialists for no extra cost. I need to service their contract as cheaply as possible, this means I will get the right person to do the right bit


that means they get expertise they wouldn’t have had in their one hire
