Some time last year I wrote this [kit list for contractors](https://deltastring.com/2023/10/23/contracting-is-all-in-the-prep/) but things change and so it's time to revisit and update. Let's dive in.<!--excerpt-end-->

I don't know where the best places are to buy this gear at the moment so I haven't linked out to stores this time. Probably your favourite charity has something set up with affiliate links for various vendors of these things.

### Avoid any single point of failure scenario

Having only one of something critical puts you only one problem away from being unable to work. If you're not solving your clients' problems they won't be paying you. You don't want to lose a day of pay (and your reputation for reliability) because you didn't think ahead on these things.

That said, you don't want to just buy two of everything. Your backup doesn't need exactly the capability of your primary option. Here are some things I think about when it is time to make changes.

### Starting with the biggest expense: your two devices

You need to have two laptops. They do need to be laptops, because there are plenty of scenarios where you need to work away from your desk. It's not worth losing a day's pay or more because your one and only laptop went bang. Get a spare, keep it updated and charged and ready to go.

Most likely you should have both a MacOS and a Windows laptop. Sometimes some software requires one or the other, sometimes you need to test something on each. You need one of each. You probably already have a preference between the two, which dictates which is your primary device.

If you're an avid gamer, youtuber, artist, musician, something where you will use specific software or hardware, it may be worth factoring this in. I trust you can remember to consider that.

#### Apple fans

It used to be very easy to point to the Apple MacBook Pro 13" M2 but now it's hard to give an unqualified recommendation to any Apple laptop. The current "Pro" range are not such good value and start with meagre specs. You can hand over Â£2000 in the Apple store and only get 8GB RAM?

The "Air" devices are much more sensibly priced at the moment and would probably be the way I would go, despite the shorter battery life and dim screen. 16GB of RAM would be a good upgrade for most work.
