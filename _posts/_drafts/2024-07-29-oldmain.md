# Deltastring are the bespoke Zendesk solutions agency

Feel like you’re losing the battle with your own systems? Worried that you’ve built up a tangled web of legacy business rules and feeling like you need to start afresh? Want to implement something new and exciting but don't know where to begin?

### We are here to help you.

We are experienced Zendesk specialists, an all-star squad assembled from operations pros across sectors, based in the South of England. Here is how we perform best:

* API export of all Zendesk objects: views, macros, triggers, automations, roles, groups, and so on. Let's get the complete picture and full understanding.
* Version control: track all changes, document as we implement, develop a release schedule. Apply engineering principles to your instance.
* Process mapping: find how everything within your Zendesk interacts. Be sure where each ticket goes. Reverse engineer legacy routines and identify opportunities to simplify and streamline.
* Cleanup: orphaned objects are carefully removed, broken references are resolved, non-functional items are disabled.
* Establish a testing and deployment process: hypothesise and measure to be sure your changes are effective.
* All the while, enjoy enhanced support from friendly humans.
