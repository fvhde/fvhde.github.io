title: Why are we called Deltastring?
---

Sometimes I get asked about how I named the company. It's not an easy thing to do. Here's what I thought about.

Deltastring Ltd isn't my first company. I previously had a business in the restaurant trade<!--excerpt-end--> which I closed down at the end of 2019. I gave that company a name which was personal to me. I think names have a lot of influence over how we feel about things, and I would have liked to feel less bad about the end of that endeavour.

### Simple rules

Here are the rules I came up with for my new company name.

* The .com must be available.
* The company name must be made of existing real words.
* These words must have no homophones.
* The spelling must be unambiguous.
* The name should make sense with what we do.

I broke almost all of these rules with my first business. You get sick of having to spell out your email address, correcting people over and over.

There are no single word .com domains available for real English words, so I needed a two word name. I generated some lists and checked DNS servers for those domains. Deltastring jumped out as a name which everyone can spell and has some logic there.
